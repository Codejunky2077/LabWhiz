    "📏 Always double-check units — μL and mL mistakes ruin entire preps.",
    "🧪 Mix solutions thoroughly — don’t assume it’s homogeneous after adding solute.",
    "🔬 Use dedicated tips and buffers for RNA work — RNases are everywhere.",
    "🧊 Keep enzymes on ice — activity drops fast even at room temp.",
    "🎯 Don’t trust pH alone — always verify ionic strength in sensitive buffers.",
    "💡 Label with date and initials — mystery tubes cost time and samples.",
    "🚿 Wipe pipettes regularly — cross-contamination is sneakier than you think.",
    "🧫 Vortex only when protocol says so — not all reagents tolerate agitation.",
    "🧯 Never microwave sealed tubes — pressure buildup can cause explosions.",
    "🧰 Pre-weigh chemicals over paper or boat — balances are sensitive to spills.",
    "📅 Make fresh working dilutions — avoid reusing week-old diluted reagents.",
    "👁️ Scan protocols fully before starting — assumptions = errors.",
    "♻️ Calibrate pipettes if they feel ‘off’ — accuracy degrades silently.",]
